# History

Kagi was founded by Vladimir Prelovac in May 2018 in Palo Alto, CA (USA). Kagi is and has been and completely self-funded since inception.

We are not affiliated with the legendary Kagi - the shareware payments platform. That Kagi went bankrupt in an unfortunate turn of events. We liked the name and acquired it when we got the chance.
  
## Early years

In the first couple years (2018 - 2019) Kagi was focused on the AI aspect, driven by the notion that any future search engine will need to have a strong instant question-answering component. We called it "[the last mile of search](https://kagi.ai/last-mile-for-web-search.html)" and this project gave us domain knowledge and expertise used in Kagi Search today. Other experiments like [video question answering](https://vimeo.com/754908681) were built during this period.

In 2019 the [first prototype of Kagi Search](https://vimeo.com/754899234) is made public. It used an unusual MUD-like, command-line mode with powerful features built in.  During this year we decide that world needs a better, user-centric, browser too and we discover that it is possible to port the WebExtensions API to WebKit allowing an iOS web browser to run extensions.
