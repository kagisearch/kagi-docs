- **Search Results per Page** — Choose to show All, 10, or 20 results per page.
- **Result Snippet Length** — Influence how snippets are chosen from our indexes, whether to prefer short and punctual snippets, or longer detailed ones.
- **Search Bangs** — Choose whether to allow the use of [search bangs](bangs.md). For example, [!r merge lane etiquette](https://kagi.com/search?q=!r%20merge%20lane%20etiquette) will search Reddit for you.
  - **Allowed Quick Bangs** — Choose whether to use up to 20 bangs without the '!' character. For example, 'r' followed by a 'space' would activate a search on Reddit.
- **Instant Answers** — Choose whether to allow answers to your questions using Kagi AI at the top of your search results. For example, try a search for [how far is the moon from earth](https://kagi.com/search?q=how+far%20is%20the%20moon%20from%20earth).
- **Inline Videos** — Choose whether inline videos will appear in results.

- **Inline Discussions** — Choose whether inline discussions will appear in results.
Discussions are collected from forum posts related to your query.

This section typically features technical blog posts and opinion pieces from forums. It can be useful when researching or looking for what people are saying about a particular topic.
- **Wikipedia** — Choose whether the Wikipedia widget will appear in results.
- **Related Searches** — Choose whether related searches will be shown with results.
- **Listicles** — Choose whether listicle results will be shown. Listicles are short-form writing that uses a list as its thematic structure.
