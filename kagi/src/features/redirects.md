# Redirects (URL Rewrites)

Redirects are a powerful feature that allow you to make modifications to search result URLs with textual find & replace.

Some use cases of redirects include:

- Change domains to a preferred domain (`reddit.com` to `old.reddit.com`)
- Fixing links to outdated documentation with bad SEO 
- Rewriting proxied pages (like Google AMP) to their source URL
- Changing any `http` link to `https`

## Managing Redirects

You can manage redirects in your [Advanced](https://kagi.com/settings?p=advanced) settings menu, under **Redirects**.

![Redirects Settings Location](media/redirects-nav.png)

This will open the [Redirects Settings Page](https://kagi.com/settings?p=redirects):

To create a new Redirect, press the **Add Rule** button on the [Redirects settings page](https://kagi.com/settings?p=redirects).
This will open a form with instructions and some examples to get you started.

You can edit an existing Redirect by pressing the pencil icon.

By hovering on this icon, a tooltip will appear showing you the original URL.

## Redirect Syntax

A redirect looks like this:

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span>^https://reddit.com/|https://old.reddit.com/</span>
</div>

It is composed of the following parts:

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span style="color:blue;">^https://reddit.com/</span>
  <span>|</span>
  <span style="color:green;">https://old.reddit.com/</span>
</div>

- The <span style="color:blue;">regex match pattern</span>
- A pipe (`|` ) separator character
- The <span style="color:green;">replacement pattern</span>

The match pattern is written using [Regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), a standard language for pattern matching sequences of text.

The replacement pattern is a verbatim string that will replace then entire URL.

You can use `$1`, `$2`, and so on in the replacement pattern to refer to *capture groups* in the match pattern, to retain parts of the original URL.
Capture groups in regex are parts of the pattern that are enclosed in parentheses `()`.

For every URL on the page that matches the match pattern, a replacement will be triggered using the replacement pattern.

## Regex Help

If you've never used regex before - and even if you have - regex can be hard to get right!

Here are some resources to help you write and understand regex:

- [Regex 101](https://regex101.com/), a sandbox for writing and testing regex
- [QuickREF.ME - Regex Cheatsheet](https://quickref.me/regex), a quick reference on regex syntax

## Examples

### Changing a domain

We can make all `https://reddit.com` links change to `https://old.reddit.com` using a rule like this:

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span style="color:blue;">^</span>
  <span>https://reddit.com/</span>
  <span>|</span>
  <span style="color:green;">https://old.reddit.com/</span>
</div>

- <span style="color:blue;">^</span> matches the start of the URL.
  This will stop the rule from matching a URL that has the domain elsewhere in the URL.

- `http://reddit.com` matches exactly this text.

- <span style="color:green;">https://old.reddit.com/</span> is the replacement.

> In this example, because our replacement pattern did not alter the original URL's path, Kagi will keep the original path for you.
>
> See the [Safety](#safety) section for more details.

### Changing part of a path

Some documentation websites put a version number in the path of the URL.
Sometimes this version number can be outdated in search indexes, so we can use a redirect to help us here.

In this example, we will detect any URL like the following:

- `https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.22/tokio/fn.spawn.html`
- `https://docs.rs/smol/1.2.5/smol/struct.Async.html`
- `https://docs.rs/sqlx/0.3.0/sqlx/index.html`

and use a replacement to change the version number to the word `latest`.

This can be done with a single redirect like this following:

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span style="color:blue">^https://docs.rs/([^/]+)/(?:[^/]+)/(.*)</span>
  <span>|</span>
  <span style="color:green">https://docs.rs/$1/latest/$2</span>
</div>

This example is a bit more complex, so we will walk through each part.

#### Match Pattern

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span style="color:blue;">^</span>
  <span >https://docs.rs</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:red;">([^/]+)</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:gray">(?:[^/]+)</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:green">(.*)</span>
</div>

<span style="color:blue;">^</span> matches the start of the URL.

`https://docs.rs/` matches the domain of the website.

<span style="color:red;font-family:monospace">([\^/]+)</span> is the *first capturing group*.
This matches anything up to the next `/`.
This group will be assigned to <span style="color:red">$1</span>.

<span style="color:gray;font-family:monospace">(?:[\^/]+)</span> is a *non-capturing group*, indicated by the `?:`.
This matches anything up to the next `/`.
Because of `?:`, it is not assigned to any `$`.

<span style="color:green;font-family:monospace">(.*)</span> is the *second capturing group*.
This matches *everything* that follows, to the end of the URL.
This match will be assigned to <span style="color:green">$2</span>.

#### Replacement Pattern

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span >https://docs.rs</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:red;">$1</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span>latest</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:green">$2</span>
</div>

`https://docs.rs` writes the domain.

<span style="color:red">$1</span> copies from the *first capture group*.

`latest` writes in the word "latest".

<span style="color:green">$2</span> copies from the *second capture group*.

#### Conclusion

Given the rule:

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span style="color:blue;">^</span>
  <span >https://docs.rs</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:red;">([^/]+)</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:gray">(?:[^/]+)</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:green">(.*)</span>
  <span style="">|</span>
  <span >https://docs.rs</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:red;">$1</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span>latest</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:green">$2</span>
</div>

Will match:

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span >https://docs.rs</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:red;">tokio</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:gray">0.2.22</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:green">tokio/fn.spawn.html</span>
</div>

And the replacement will make:

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span >https://docs.rs</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:red;">tokio</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span>latest</span>
  <span style="">/</span>
  <span style="color:green">tokio/fn.spawn.html</span>
</div>

## Safety

Redirects have a few "safety" features to help make your redirects simpler, and to prevent the URL from becoming unusable.

When possible:

1. If your rewrite pattern does not alter the path of the URL, the original path will be retained.

2. If your rewrite pattern does not include a scheme (`http`, `https`), it will use the orignial URL's scheme.

3. If your rewrite generates a URL without a host or a path (i.e., empty), it will not be replaced.

For example, this means the [reddit example](#changing-a-domain) can also be simplified like this:

<div class="rewrite-example">
  <span style="color:blue;">^</span>
  <span>https://reddit.com/</span>
  <span>|</span>
  <span style="color:green;">old.reddit.com</span>
</div>

and it will work the same way.
