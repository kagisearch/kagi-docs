# Bangs

Kagi supports all [DuckDuckGo-style bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bang). Bangs are shortcuts starting with exclamation points (!) that quickly take you to search results on other sites.

For example, searching Kagi for **!w Monty Python** will search Wikipedia directly for "Monty Python" and take you to that Wikipedia search result.

Bangs can also be used regionally. For example, you can search with  **!de [query]** or **!nl [query]** to switch your region to Germany or Netherlands on the fly.

Some of the more popular search bangs include:

- **!r** for [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com)
- **!u** for [Urban Dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com)
- **!imd** for the [Internet Movie Database](https://www.imdb.com/)
- **!i** for Kagi Images

- **!n** for Kagi News

- **!help**  to search this knowledge base for information about Kagi Search
