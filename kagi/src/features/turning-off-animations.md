# Turning Off Animations

Perhaps you don't wish to see animations used in Kagi. Kagi respects the "Reduce Motion" accessibility setting in your operating system (OS). The exact name for this can differ by OS.

Here is where to find the settings for each OS:

- In **macOS**: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display > Reduce motion.
- In **iOS/iPadOS**: Settings > General > Accessibility > Reduce Motion.
- In **Windows 11:** Settings > Accessibility > Visual Effects > Animation Effects
- In **Windows 10**: Settings > Ease of Access > Display > Show animations in Windows.
- In **Windows 7**: Control Panel > Ease of Access > Make the computer easier to see > Turn off all unnecessary animations (when possible).
- In **Android 9+**: Settings > Accessibility > Remove animations.
- In **GTK/GNOME 43+**: Settings > Accessibility > Enable Animations (turn it off)
- In **GNOME 42 and Before**: GNOME Tweaks > General tab (or Appearance, depending on version) > Animations is turned off.
- In **Plasma/KDE**: System Settings > Workspace Behavior -> General Behavior > "Animation speed" is set all the way to the right to "Instant".
