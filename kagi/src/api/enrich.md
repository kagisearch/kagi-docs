# Enrichment APIs

The enrichment APIs are a collection of indexes that can be used to supplement other products with more novel content from around the web.

They are best used for finding non-commerical websites and "small web" discussions surrounding a particular topic.
They are not "general" search indexes that can answer any type of query.

## Pricing

All `/enrich` APIs are currently billed at $2/1000 searches ($0.002 USD per search).

## Endpoints

### `GET /enrich/web`

Fetch enrichment results focused on general, non-commerical web content.

Returns an array of [Search Objects](./search.md#search-object).

#### Parameters
