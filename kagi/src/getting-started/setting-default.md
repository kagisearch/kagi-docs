## Option 1: Using the Kagi Browser Extension

Kagi is available as an extension for all major browsers. The extension sets Kagi as the default search engine and allows you to search with Kagi even in a private window.

Extension download links:

- [Chromium-based browsers](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cdglnehniifkbagbbombnjghhcihifij0) (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, Vivaldi...)
- [Firefox-based browsers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kagi-search-for-firefox/)
  - If you use Firefox on Android, check out [this guide](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/09/29/expanded-extension-support-in-firefox-for-android-nightly/). Android doesn't set Kagi as the default search engine, but it allows search in private mode to work normally.
- [Safari for macOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/kagi-search-for-safari/id1622835804)
- [Safari for iOS and iPadOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/kagi-search-for-safari/id1607766153)
- The [xSearch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xsearch-for-safari/id1579902068) and [HyperWeb](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hyperweb/id1581824571) extensions for Safari also support Kagi

If you are a macOS, iOS, or iPadOS user, you can complement your Kagi experience with the free [Orion](https://browser.kagi.com) web browser, produced by the same team that built Kagi Search.

### Note for Safari Users: Browsing History

When you install the Kagi Search browser extension in Safari, you will see the extension requires access to your browsing history. This access is needed so the extension can intercept queries sent to other search engines and instead send them to Kagi Search.

No data from your browsing history is sent to Kagi Search beyond the search queries you make while running the extension. All queries made to Kagi Search are anonymized, never being tied to your specific Kagi Search account.

### Note for Brave Users: Settings Update

In addition to installing the Kagi Browser Extension, Brave users must also make a settings change in the Brave web browser:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Search engine** ([link](brave://settings/?search=index+other+search)).
2. Turn on the "Index other search engines" option.
