# Search is in Public Beta

While Kagi Search is in public beta, we don't feel our vision is fully realized and ready for prime time. But we also don't want to build something in isolation. We want to build it with you, our users. We appreciate your support and patience as Kagi Search evolves.

During this time, we plan to fix bugs, introduce more core features, and improve the stability of the product.

You can read more about this in our public betaÂ [announcement post](https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-orion-public-beta).

Kagi Search is driven by the needs of its users and we want to hear from you. Join our [feedback forum](https://kagifeedback.org/) and our [Discord server](https://kagi.com/discord). Help us make Kagi Search even better for you.
