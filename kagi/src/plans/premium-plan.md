# Premium Plans

## Signing Up for the Premium Plans

You can [Sign Up](https://kagi.com/signup) for a new Kagi account and select the [Plan Type](plan-types.md) during the sign-up process.

If you already have a Kagi account, you can upgrade your plan type in your [Billing settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=billing).

## Managing Billing

To manage your Kagi [Premium plan](plan-types.md) billing, go to your [Billing settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=billing).

Once in Billing settings, click the **Manage Billing** button. This button will take you to a webpage for Stripe, our payment processor.

From that Stripe page, you can:

- Change your payment method
- Change your billing information
- See your invoices
- Switch between monthly and annual billing (use the **Update plan** button)

## Managing Pay-per-use Options
From within the billing screen you can change your pay-per-use limits and set two different types of limits:
* The soft limit triggers a notification regarding pay-per-use cost
* The hard limit prevents further searches so you do not incur additional costs.
