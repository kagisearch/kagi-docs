# Family Plan

Since the inception, Kagi has been driven by the idea of humanizing the web, especially for families and kids. Our commitment to this cause was the inspiration behind the creation of Kagi. Many of our staff are parents are are working together to build a better search and web future for our children. We strive to provide a search engine that prioritizes the well-being of your loved ones, particularly the most vulnerable ones like children, by offering an ad-free and safe browsing experience. We offer two different group plans based on your specific needs.
