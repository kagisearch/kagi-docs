# Team Plan

## Inquire About Team Plan
If you are interested in a plan for your team please inquire by emailing 

## Adding Team Members
Since the Kagi Team Plan is pay-per-use, you can add as many team members as you want and only pay for those that are actively searching. 

From the [Invites tab](https://kagi.com/settings?p=invites) there are two ways to add new team members. 
1. Send the new members an email through Kagi.
2. Generate an invite link and share with the new members. 

You can also limit the domains used to sign up to your team to your companyâ€™s domain or reset the invite link if necessary.
