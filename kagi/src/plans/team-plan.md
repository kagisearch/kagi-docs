## Signing Up for the Team Plan

You can [Sign Up](https://kagi.com/signup) for a new Kagi account and add the [Team Plan](plan-types.md) during the sign-up process.

If you already have a Kagi account, you can add the Team Plan in your [Billing settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=billing).

You will need to specify a company when signing up for a Team Plan. 

You can also check out all [Team Plan Features](../features/team-plan-features.md).

## Adding Team Members
Since the Kagi Team Plan is pay-per-use ($0.025 per search), you can add as many team members as possible and only pay for those that are actively searching. 

From the [Invites tab](https://kagi.com/settings?p=invites) there are two ways to add new team members. 
1. Send the new members an email through Kagi.
2. Generate an invite link and share with the new members. 

You can also limit the domains used to sign-up to your team to your companyâ€™s domain or reset the invite link if necessary.
