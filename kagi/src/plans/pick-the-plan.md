# Pick The Right Plan

## Understand Your Consumption
Kagi has a feature to check your [current search usage](https://kagi.com/settings?p=consumption) to get a better sense of which plan is right for you. 

## Think Through Consumption
We understand picking the right plan can be challenging, we have expterise in this area and are prepared to help!

As stated the new Standard plan pricing will be $5/month, with 200  searches included. This should be enough for 99% of regular Internet users who are new to paid search engines and are looking to own their search experience.  

The new Professional plan will be $10/month and include 700 searches which is ideal for internet professionals (researchers, etc) and developers (programmers, software, etc). 

These plans also have pay-per-use searches on demand, which are priced at 1.5 cents per search.

Now consider an example:

* If a new user averages 5 searches per day (150/month), they’ll pay $5.00.
* If a new users averages 10 searches per day (300/month), they’ll pay $5 + 100 * $0.015 = $6.50.
* If a new users averages 30 searches per day (900/month), they’ll pay $10 + 200 * $0.015 = $13.00.

If you find yourself going over $25 per month due to increased pay-per-use search then you may want to consider the Ultimate plan. 

## Compare Yourself
The average Kagi user is searching 700 times per month and we designed the **Professional** plan with this consumption in mind. 
* If you search less than 533 times per month, the Standard plan will be cheapest. 
* If you search more than 533, but less than 1700 times (2000 for early adopters) per month, the Professional plan is the cheapest. 
* If you search more than 1700 times (2000 for early adopters) per month, the Ultimate plan is for you.
