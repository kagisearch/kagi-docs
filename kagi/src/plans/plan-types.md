# Plan Types

Kagi offers several individual subscriptions plans.

![Individual Plans](media/individual_plans.png)

* The **Trial** plan is limited to 100 total searches. This plan is suited for those interested in exploring Kagi and are curious about paid search engines.  
* The **Standard** plan offers 300 searches for USD $5 per month. This plan is suited for users who are new to paid search engines and are looking to own their search experience.
* The **Professional** plan offers 1,000 searches USD $10 per month. This plan is suited for internet professionals and developers who are prolific and advanced search users.
* The [**Ultimate**](./ultimate-plan.md) plan offers unlimited searches for USD $25 per month and offers the most flexibility and power to the user.

We also offer [Family plans](./family-plan.md) for two or more people.

## How searches are counted

* [Bangs](../features/bangs.md) and search suggestions (while typing) are never counted as searches.
* Reloading the same search within a short time (~2 minutes) does not count as an additional search.
* Each [lens](../features/lenses.md) and content type (e.g. images, news) is considered a separate search.
* Loading more results counts as an additional search.

Note that searches do not roll over to the next month; the number of available searches resets each month. Months are counted starting from the date of subscription, and are not necessarily aligned with the months of the year.

## Legacy Subscribers and Early Adopters

For any existing subscribers and early adopters who are interested in how legacy accounts will be used and maintained please refer to the blog post [Updates to Kagi Search pricing](https://blog.kagi.com/update-kagi-search-pricing#existing).

## Pay Per Use Enhancement

The **Standard** and **Professional** plans both feature Pay Per Use options within the Billing Settings. Searches beyond the monthly included searches, are priced at 1.5 cents per search. There are two limits that you can set to control your cost:

* The soft limit triggers a notification regarding pay-per-use cost
* The hard limit prevents further searches so you do not incur additional costs.

## Why Tiered Pricing

This tiered pricing system is easy to understand and ensures Kagi’s financial sustainability for the future so that we can continue to provide you with the tools to own your search experience as we pursue our mission to humanize the web.
