Note that no search count rolls over month to month, this is a monthly number that resets each month. 

## Pay Per Use Enhancement 
The **Standard** and **Professional** plans both feature Pay Per Use options within the Billing Settings. Searches beyond the monthy included searches, are priced at 1.5 cents per search. There are two limts that you can set to control your cost:

* The soft limit triggers a notification regarding pay-per-use cost
* The hard limit prevents further searches so you do not incur additional costs.
