Note that no search count rolls over month to month, this is a monthly number that resets each month. 

## Pay Per Use Enhancement 
The **Standard** and **Professional** plans both feature a [**Pay Per Use**](https://kagi.com/settings?p=billing) option within the Billing Settings. Searches beyond the monthy allotment are priced at 1.5 cents per search. There are two limts that you can set:
* The soft limit triggers a notification regarding pay-per-use cost
* The hard limit prevents further searches so you do not incur additional costs.
