# Why Pay for Search

Kagi is a paid search engine with the goal of humanizing the web and giving users the ability to take control of their search experience by removing the influence of paid advertisers which incentize large scale free search engines. 

## Search Is Not Free
Currently Kagi spends about USD 1.25 cents per search however  search indexes are about to become several times more expensive and we now have the AI integration cost. It is our intention to keep the cost at USD 1.5 cents per search or below by rethinking our partnering strategy and investing more into our infrastructure. 

## How You Currently Pay for Search
According to Google Search Statistics the average person searches Google three or four times per day or 90-120 times per month. According to DuckDuckGo’s data, the monthly average is about 30 searches per person or one per day. These search results are substantially impacted by advertisers and affiliate links that pay Google to influence your results. The cost is not free, you are paying with your time and cognitive bandwidth required to parse the results to find what is actually relevant. Consider how much time you spend scrolling through initial results to pass over the results you know are meaningless. Also consider the personal information you are sharing and losing control of as you use the search services that present themselves as free. Your 

## The Numbers Tell a Tale
Each user is worth X/month due to adtech revenue, Kagi needs X/month to sustainably bring P privacy, F functional and A AI features to the table, we're trying together to get rid of future C consequences in our lives and our kids and society, etc.

## We Don't Offer a Free Tier
While it’s true that many average search users may not be willing to pay for a search engine (yet!), we want to make our platform accessible to as many people as possible. The Standard plan is our way of providing an option for those users who may not require the advanced features of our professional plans. In addition, we have received requests from casual users and students for a starter-level plan. However, it’s important to note that our core focus remains on professionals, and they will continue to be the driving force behind our product roadmap.



one of the things we can compare is how much your search is worth vs how much we cahrge for it.. and you calc its value by taking google's revenue from searh ads divided by total number of searches.. should be around 10 cents per search range


What could help me when I start this discussion with my wife later (and I would wait for it), is to have a webpage on your main site with very clear copy on what are the tradeoffs of using those paid engines, vs Kagi. (My wife will not spend time reading your blog posts.) 
I'm also wondering where the definition of "6" for a family will lead us.

We have 5 kids and subscribe to the family plan of our favorite password manager (we'll be able to buy one more seat for a proportional price, so it's ok). We're also a family in Apple's services, in which it doesn't seem possible at all to add one more family member. This one makes me cringe and I don't understand how a corporation as big as Apple can get away with it and feel good in front of their user base. After all, so many things become possible in families in this ecosystem. When our youngest one becomes old enough to use these accounts, I hope the world of software will have opened up more to the human dimensions of our families. I don't see myself telling my youngest one: dear, I don't know what to say, these companies don't believe you can be part of our family, I had to set you up alone, and because of that, you can't X with us and we can't Y with you...

I know it's early for you and I hope you'll be able to offer us, someday, to buy more seats with a proportional price add-on.

### Speed
We’re obsessed with increasing speed and lowering latency, and we currently use three approaches.

First, we optimized our technology stack to increase code execution speed and decrease connection latency. 

Second, we reduced data transfer between Kagi and the browser, in some cases as much as 20x less compared to some of our competitors! This reduction has the neat side-effect of reducing CO2 emissions. Using Kagi Search will benefit the environment as well as you!
