# Kagi vs. DuckDuckGo

DuckDuckGo has shown the world that a privacy-first search engine is possible, and we respect this contribution. But its innovation has slowed in the past decade. And, ad-supported business models will always force a company to make compromises and balance between serving users and advertisers. In the end, DuckDuckGo's search product is just ”good enough” (by our standard, sorry, DuckDuckGo!) and has been stagnant for years without any ground-breaking feature development.

In contrast, Kagi search does not need to compromise on user experience. Everything we do is user-centric. Kagi Search already has many unique features, like [Lenses](/../features/lenses.md) and [Personalized Results](../features/website-info-personalized-results.md#personalized_results). And because we depend only on our users for revenue, Kagi can and will always offer a much richer search experience for the user.
