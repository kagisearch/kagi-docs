## Billing Settings: Pay Per Use

The **Standard** and **Professional** plans both feature Pay Per Use options within the Billing Settings. Searches beyond the monthly included searches, are priced at 1.5 cents per search. There are two limits that you can set to control your cost:

* The soft limit triggers a notification regarding pay-per-use cost
* The hard limit prevents further searches so you do not incur additional costs.

## Billing Settings: Retry Billing

If your billing gets declined you will need to retry the billing attempt for the invoice by selecting the Manage Billing option under your Billing Settings

## Billing Settings: Orion Support

If you are supporting the Orion Browser made by the same team that builds Kagi you will see the subscription listed at the bottom of the page with the option to cancel (though we will work hard to make sure you do not!)

## Monthly Search Usage

Toggling to this tab shows how many searches you've made over time and how that usage relates to any payments you've made.
