# Kagi Ai

Kagi has long heritage in AI, in fact we started as kagi.ai in 2018 and we've previously published products, research and even a sci-fi story about AI. While generative AI opens a new paradigm of search and a vast search space of queries that never previously existed we have taken special care to ensure a thoughtful user experience guided by this philosophy of AI integration. 

We postulate that:

* AI should be used in closed, defined, context relevant to search (not to be a therapist for example)
* AI should be used to enhance search experience, not to create it (similar to how we use JavaScript, meaning Kagi works perfectly fine without it)
* AI should be used to the extent that does not diminish our humanity (AI is a tool, not a replacement for brain)

Kagi uses cutting edge AI technology and models to provide you with first-in-class AI backed functionality to enhance your experience. While we continue to add and embellish this technology we will continue to release previews, collect feedback and deploy additional features and updates.
