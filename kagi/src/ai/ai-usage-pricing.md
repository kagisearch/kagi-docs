# AI Usage Pricing

AI tools are powerful and are more expensive to run than standard search, therefore we consider the AI tool usage in addition to standard search. Using AI tools will incur additional cost and be treated as search usage according to your Kagi plan. In general, we count 1,000 tokens processed by AI as one search, and tokens are influenced by the size of the AI request submitted.

 In practice, this means that:

* Summarize results will typically use 700-800 tokens, or less than 1 search
* Ask Questions about Document will typically use 500-1000 tokens per question (depending on document size)
* Summarize Page depends on the document size, with maximum processed tokens set to 10,000 even if the page has more than that. 

For example, if you are summarizing an entire book with 100,000 words, it will cost you approximately 10 searches.
