# Kagi Inc. Documentation

This repository contains open-source documentation for products made by Kagi Inc. The documentation is written to be hosted with the open-source [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) documentation utility.

Currently, the documentation is limited to the [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com) product, which you can [view online](https://docs.kagi.com/search/).

Documentation for the [Orion web browser](https://browser.kagi.com) will be added to the repository in the near future. Kagi Inc. will also release documentation for any future products here.

Feedback about the Kagi Search documentation can be made in several places:
