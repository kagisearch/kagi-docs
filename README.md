# Kagi Inc. Documentation

This repository contains open-source documentation for products made by Kagi Inc. The documentation is written to be hosted with the open-source [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) documentation utility.

Currently, the documentation is limited to the [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com) product, which you can [view online](https://docs.kagi.com/search/).

Feedback about the Kagi Search documentation can be shared on our [Discord Server](https://kagi.com/discord) in the **\#documentation** channel. We would love to hear your thoughts on anything we can fix or improve.

Documentation for the [Orion web browser](https://browser.kagi.com) will be added to this repository in the near future. Kagi Inc. will also release documentation for any future products here.
