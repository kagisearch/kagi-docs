# Customizing Kagi CSS

[Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) (CSS) is a language used to stylize HTML elements in web pages. You can fully customize Kagi's search and landing pages with your own CSS. 

You can use up to 10,000 characters to customize your Kagi Search CSS. Custom CSS does not apply on Settings pages. 

Customization is done in your [Appearance settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=custom_css).

Use the **no\_css** query parameter (for example, kagi.com/search?q=test&no\_css) to disable your custom CSS if something horribly breaks!

The [Kagi Discord](https://kagi.com/discord) server has an **\#appearance** channel where people are sharing custom CSS examples. A community member also started a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KagiUserCSS/) where CSS can be shared.
