# Welcome to Kagi Search Docs!

Kagi is a lightning-fast, user-centric, 100% privacy-respecting search engine with results augmented by non-commercial indexes and personalized searches. We're glad you're here!

If you're new to Kagi Search, our [Quick Start](./getting-started/quick-start.md) and [FAQs](./getting-started/faqs.md) are great places to begin.

You can access our documentation in several ways:

- Click or tap an article link from the list.
- Click or tap the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen and do a search.
- Use the **!help** [bang](./features/bangs.md) in Kagi Search. For example, searching in Kagi for [!help setting Kagi as default search engine](https://kagi.com/search?q=!help%20setting%20kagi%20as%20default%20search%20engine) will show you results containing our default search documentation.
 
Feedback about this Kagi Search documentation can be shared on our [Discord Server](https://kagi.com/discord) in the **\#documentation** channel. We would love to hear your thoughts on anything we can fix or improve.
