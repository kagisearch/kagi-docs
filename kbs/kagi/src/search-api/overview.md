# Overview

The search API provides programmatic access to data that powers our search
results & more.

> Note: **Kagi Search API is currently only available on the Team Plan**.

## Beta Status

**The API is currently in a "v0" beta status.** Changes will be ongoing,
and will be added to the documentation below as features become available.

Use at your own risk, but please reach out to us if you have any questions.

See the [Support](#support) and [Contributing](../welcome.md#contributing)
sections for details.

## API Usage Billing

API usage is billed the same as your normal account activity. If you are
on a pay-per-search plan, then searching with the API will also count as
a search with your account, attributed to your active billing account.

Endpoints that contribute to your billing account's usage will be marked
with a note:

> This is a **PAID** endpoint.
