# Product Roadmap & Feedback Forum

You can view our [Kagi Search Product Roadmap](https://kagifeedback.org/roadmap) to see the bug reports and feature requests we are discussing, reviewing, and planning to address.

The Roadmap is part of our [Kagi Search feedback forum](https://kagifeedback.org), where you are welcome to submit bug reports and feature requests of your own. Our community drives the future product direction of Kagi Search and we hope you will become a part of it.
