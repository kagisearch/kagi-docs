# Working at Kagi

- Do you have advanced Crystal (backend) and/or vanilla JavaScript (frontend) knowledge?
- Can you solve difficult problems and code exceptionally well? (We’ll send a test project.)
- Do you want to be a part of an international and fully-remote team building products with care?

If so, send your CV to [vlad@kagi.com](mailto:vlad@kagi.com).

Fun fact: All of Kagi Search works without JavaScript enabled in the browser. We see JavaScript as a way to enhance the product experience, not create it.
