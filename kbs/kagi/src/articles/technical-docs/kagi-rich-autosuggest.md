# Kagi Rich Autosuggest

Are you building an app or service and want to include Kagi Search autosuggestions as a feature?

Our internal autosuggest endpoint is **https://kagi.com/autosuggest**. It takes a parameter, **q**, as the query. It will return a structured response with details if the suggestion maps to a [bang](/articles/features/bangs.md), etc.

More information is available in an [overview](https://hackmd.io/@z64/rkdV748xj) covering the endpointâ€™s behavior and general details about bangs.
