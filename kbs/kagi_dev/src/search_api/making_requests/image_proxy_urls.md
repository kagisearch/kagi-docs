# Image Proxy URLs

Some API results will contain links to images using our proxy infrastructure,
for protecting user privacy from the source image's webserver.

It will be noted in the object documentation if the URL will be proxied or
not.

They will be returned as a bare path like:

```
/proxy/filename.jpg?c=CRYPTOGRAPHC_HASH
```

The base URL for these endpoints is currently `https://kagi.com`.
