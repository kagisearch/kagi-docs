# Base API URL

Unless otherwise noted, the base URL for all requests is:

```
https://kagi.com/api/$VERSION
```

Where `$VERSION` is a [listed active API version](api_versions.md).

For example, the full URL for the [Execute Search](endpoints/execute_search.md)
endpoint is:

```
https://kagi.com/api/v0/search
```

> Note: Currently the Search API is in beta. During this period, the only
> active version is "v0", and breaking changes may occur any time as we 
> continue developing the API.
