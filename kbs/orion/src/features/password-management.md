## Password Storage & Sync

Many users of Safari on Apple devices use iCloud Keychain to automatically sync Safari data, including website passwords, across devices.

Third-party web browsers, like Orion, cannot sync with the Keychain used by Safari. Orion must use its own Orion-specific Keychain. Safari cannot see the Orion Keychain and Orion cannot see the Safari Keychain.

If you want to use your Safari passwords in Orion, you will need to import the passwords into Orion on macOS. Then, you can use the passwords in Orion on all Apple devices through Orion's own Keychain sync.

## Importing Safari Passwords into Orion on macOS

Orion on macOS can import your passwords from Safari 15+ on macOS. These versions of Safari ship with macOS 12 (Monterey) and macOS 13 (Ventura). They are also available on macOS 11 (Big Sur) through the [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/).

Once you have Safari 15+, follow these steps in Orion:

1. Click the **File** menu, choose **Import From**, and choose **Safari**.

## 1Password & Orion

1Password has not yet added support for Orion. Because of this, the 1Password browser extension does not function properly in Orion.

We have been told by 1Password that their development team is working on a new feature to allow users to choose their trusted browser. This will hopefully allow 1Password's browser extension to then work with Orion. 1Password has not given us any time estimate for when this new feature will be released.

In the meantime, 1Password 8 for macOS has a global autofill feature that does not require using any browser extension. Click inside a login field and press the **command** and <b>\\</b> keys at the same time.
