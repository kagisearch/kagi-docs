# Discord Server

We have a [Orion Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/gKh5E6ys6D) where you can provide general feedback and directly communicate with our community.

Please use the **#introduce-yourself** channel to say hello and let everyone know a bit about you.

We'd also love to hear your initial thoughts about Orion on the **#first-impressions** channel.

To make specific feature requests or bug reports, please use our [Orion feedback forum](https://orionfeedback.org) rather than Discord.
