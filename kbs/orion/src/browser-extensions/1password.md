## 1Password & Orion

1Password has not yet added support for Orion. Because of this, the 1Password browser extension does not function properly in Orion.

We have been told by 1Password that their development team is working on a new feature to allow users to choose their trusted browser. This will hopefully allow 1Password's browser extension to then work with Orion. 1Password has not given us any time estimate for when this new feature will be released.

In the meantime, 1Password 8 for macOS has a global autofill feature that does not require using any browser extension. Click inside a login field and press the **command** and <b>\\</b> keys at the same time.
