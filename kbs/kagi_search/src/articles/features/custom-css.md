# Customizing Kagi CSS

You can fully customize Kagi's search and landing pages with your own CSS, using up to 10,000 characters. Custom CSS does not apply on Settings pages. 

Customization is done in your [Appearance settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=custom_css).

Use the **no\_css** query parameter (for example, kagi.com/search?q=test&no\_css) to disable your custom CSS if something horribly breaks!

The [Kagi Discord](https://kagi.com/discord) server has an **\#appearance** channel where people are sharing custom CSS examples. A community member also started a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/KagiUserCSS/) where CSS can be shared.
