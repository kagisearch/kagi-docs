# What is Kagi Inc.?

Kagi Inc. is a company created with the mission to humanize the web. Our goal is to amplify the web of human knowledge, creativity, and self-expression and provide the user tools to fight against the web of greed, ad-tech, and user tracking.

Kagi is currently [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com), a fast, private search engine, and [Orion Browser](https://browser.kagi.com/), a fast, zero-telemetry browser. Both are founded by [Vladimir Prelovac](https://vladimir.prelovac.com/).

> "With Kagi and Orion, we’re striving to build better ways to experience the web, ways that are safe yet fun for everyone, including my own kids."

Our company is based in the San Francisco Bay Area and is being built by a fully-remote team. Our team is small, like “feed with two pizzas” small. Of course, it’d be tricky to deliver those slices across 16 timezones, because our team is that remote.

We are not affiliated with the legendary Kagi shareware payments platform. That Kagi went bankrupt in an unfortunate turn of events. We liked the name and acquired it when we got the chance.
  
We hope that our work impacts people's lives in some small way for the better. Thank you for your interest in being a part of this!
