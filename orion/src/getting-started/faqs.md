# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

## What is Orion?

Orion is a free, lightning-fast, privacy-protecting browser for Apple users, open to the web and all its standards and protocols. It's based on the [WebKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) open-source browser engine that also powers Apple's Safari web browser. One day, we hope everyone will say Orion is the best browser for all Apple devices. 

Orion was built for professionals by professionals, but anyone can benefit from it. Installing Orion with its default settings on any Apple device will cut down on annoying ads and speed up page loads. We want everyone to enjoy the web.

## Why use Orion instead of Safari?

Safari is truly one of the best browsers you can use on macOS, and we’re grateful to Apple for creating such a solid foundation. By basing Orion on Safari’s tech stack, then adding productivity enhancements such as built-in ad-blocking, Orion can provide users with [exactly what they need](../why-orion/orion-vs-safari.md).

## Why use Orion instead of Chrome, Firefox, or other browsers based on Chromium/Firefox?

Google and Mozilla have made great technological strides over the past decades. We’re grateful for those efforts because they help us take [the next step in browser evolution](../why-orion/kagi-vs-others.md).

## How does Orion respect my online privacy?

## How does Orion protect my online privacy?

Web ads have steadily eroded the online experience with their layout crowding, page slowing, annoying popups, and insidious malware. Yet, most browsers do not block ads by default. [Orion is different](../privacy-and-security/protecting-privacy.md).
