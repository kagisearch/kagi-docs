# Live stats

We have a very simple visualisation of Orion's active user count
[here](https://browser.kagi.com/traffic.html).

Orion is zero telemetry so we do not know the actual number of users using
it. This measures only the number of auto-update pings from users who have enabled auto updates and is the best first
approximation we have.
