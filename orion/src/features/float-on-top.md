# Float on Top

Floating a window on top is a feature of many paid apps on the Mac App Store. Orion for macOS has it built-in for free.

1. While viewing a window in Orion that you want to float, click the **Window** menu.
2. Click **Float on Top** or type **Control-Command-U**.

The window will now float on top of all others. You can use the same menu choices or keyboard command on the window to disabling floating.
