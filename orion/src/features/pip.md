# Picture-in-Picture Videos

When playing a video in Orion for macOS, you can view it in Picture-in-Picture mode.

Click on the **View** menu and choose **Show Picture-in-Picture Video** or type **Control-Command-P** on your keyboard.

By default the PiP video snaps to a corner of your screen. But, you can hold down the **Command** key and drag the video to any position you wish.
