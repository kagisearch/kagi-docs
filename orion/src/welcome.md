# Welcome to the Orion Docs!

Orion is a free, lightning-fast, privacy-protecting browser for Apple users, open to the web and all its standards and protocols. One day, we hope everyone will say Orion is the best browser for all Apple devices. We're glad you're here!

**Please note that Orion Docs are in beta and thus are not yet complete.** We haven't documented all of Orion's amazing features yet. But, we will be adding more documentation here over time.

If you're new to Orion, our [Quick Start](./getting-started/quick-start.md) and [FAQs](./getting-started/faqs.md) are great places to begin.

You can access our documentation in several ways:

- Click or tap an article link from the list.
- Click or tap the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen and do a search.
- Use the **!orion** [bang](https://help.kagi.com/search/articles/features/bangs.md) in [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com). For example, searching in Kagi for [!orion setting default search engine](https://kagi.com/search?q=!orion%20setting%20default%20search%20engine) will show you results containing our documentation on how to set Orion's default search engine.
 
Feedback about this Orion documentation can be shared on our [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/gKh5E6ys6D) in the **\#documentation** channel. We would love to hear your thoughts on anything we can fix or improve.
