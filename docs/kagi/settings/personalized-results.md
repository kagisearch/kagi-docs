# Personalized Results Settings

[Personalized Results](../features/website-info-personalized-results.html#personalized-results) allows you to boost the ranking of your favorite domains, or hide results from domains you don't prefer. <br />

From the [Personalized Results Settings page](https://kagi.com/settings?p=user_ranked) you can view the domains you have previously raised or lowered, as well as add and remove domains.
