# Assistant Settings

These settings control Kagi Assistant, a product feature backed by Kagi Search and large language models.

## Preferred Assistant Mode

Controls the Assistant mode used by default (this setting is remembered for mobile/desktop separately). Read about the modes on the [Assistant feature page](../ai/assistant.md#assistant-modes).

## Custom Assistant

This advanced feature allows the creation of a custom assistant. A custom assistant is made up of three components:

1. The base mode (and variant/model where applicable)
2. Additional instructions to adjust large language model output
3. A name that will appear in the Kagi Assistant UI
