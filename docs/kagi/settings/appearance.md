## Customizing Display

In some cases you may want to apply custom CSS, a common example is removing the summary boxes at the top of search results.

This can be accomplished from within the [Custom CSS](https://kagi.com/settings?p=custom_css) editor.

In the editor add following contents:
<code>.searchResultAnswers {
  display: none;
}</code>

Once entered click "Apply Custom CSS" and refresh search results.
