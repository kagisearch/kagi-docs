- **Fewer Results per Page** — Choose whether to break search results into smaller pages.
- **Verbatim mode** — Choose whether [verbatim mode](../features/verbatim) is automatically enabled when searching.
- **Result Snippet Length** — Influence how snippets are chosen from our indexes, whether to prefer short and punctual snippets, or longer detailed ones.
- **Search Bangs** — Choose whether to allow the use of [search bangs](../features/bangs.md). For example, [!r merge lane etiquette](https://kagi.com/search?q=!r%20merge%20lane%20etiquette) will search Reddit for you.
