# Kagi Webmaster Tools

Kagi Webmaster Tools helps site owners verify their domains and see how Kagi knows about their pages. It is designed to be simple and transparent: verify ownership, then view your crawl coverage.

## What it does

- Lets you prove you control a domain.
- Shows how many pages we have for your domain.
- Lists the specific URLs we know about.
- Displays when each page was last crawled and where it was discovered (for example, sitemap or links).

## How to use it

1. Add your domain.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to verify ownership.
2. Choose a verification method (file or DNS TXT) and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once verified, review the page list and crawl details.

## Coming soon

- Request recrawls.
- Exclude or purge pages.
- More diagnostic detail for crawl coverage.
