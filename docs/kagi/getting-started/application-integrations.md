# Integrating Kagi with Other Applications

Kagi can be integrated with other applications to make it easy to quickly search the web from within those applications.

## Alfred

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a productivity application for macOS that allows you to quickly search your computer and the web. Kagi can be added as a [custom search](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/web-search/#custom) so that you can launch a Kagi search from within Alfred.

To configure Kagi as a custom search in Alfred:

1. Open Alfred's preferences.
2. Click the **Features** icon.
3. Click the **Web Search** icon.
4. Click the **Add Custom Search** button.
5. Enter the following information:
    1. Enter your Kagi **Session Link** as the **Search URL**. You can obtain your Kagi **Session Link** from the [Account Settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=user_details).
    2. Add `&q={query}` at the end of the **Session Link** after pasting it in Alfred.
    3. Enter **Search Kagi for '{query}'** as the **Title**.
    4. Enter **kagi** as the **Keyword**.
    5. Download a Kagi PNG logo of your choice from [Kagi Search Assets](https://kagi.com/assets) and save it to your computer.
    6. Drag and drop the Kagi PNG logo into the **Icon** field.

Your configuration should now look like this:

6. Click **Test** in the **Validation** section to verify that the search works.
    1. Your default web browser should open and perform a Kagi search for the word **alfredapp**.
7. Click **Save** to save the custom search.

You should now have an entry for Kagi:

Now you can search Kagi from within Alfred by typing **kagi** followed by your search terms. For example, to search Kagi for **Orion** you would activate Alfred and type **kagi Orion**.

### Fallback Search

You can also configure Alfred to use Kagi as a [Fallback Search](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/features/default-results/fallback-searches/). Fallback searches occur when you search for a keyword in Alfred that doesn't match a result on your local computer.

To configure Kagi as a fallback search in Alfred:

1. Open Alfred's preferences.
2. Click the **Features** icon.
3. Click the **Default Results** icon.
4. Click the **Setup Fallback results** button.
5. Click the **+** button.
6. Navigate to **Custom Search**.
7. Click the **Search Kagi for {query}** search.

You should now see Kagi in the list:

8. Drag the **Search Kagi for {query}** search to the top of the list, or any other position you prefer.
9. Click the **Save** button.

You should now have Kagi available as a fallback search:
