# Setting Kagi as Default on Vanadium (Mobile - GrapheneOS)

## OpenSearch Metadata Method

To set Kagi as the default search engine on Vanadium for mobile devices running Graphene OS:

1. Open a new tab in the Vanadium browser and log in to the Kagi.com search page.
1. Once logged in to Kagi, perform at least 3-5 searches. Performing a variety of searches using Kagi.com will allow Vanadium browser to identify the new search engine using OpenSearch metadata. It is recommended to do a few searches from one tab, open another tab and do a few sesarches from there. Each time navigating both backwards to the main Kagi search website from the results page, as well as re-inputting the Kagi search website address in the address bar to initiate new searches.
1. Next, tap the three dots to open the Vanadium menu. Tap "Settings". Under Basics, tap "Search engine". If you have performed enough searches using Kagi.com, Kagi will show up in the list of available search engines to choose from. Select "Kagi (kagi.com)" and close the settings menu. You can now search from the address bar using Kagi as your default search engine!
    - If you don't see "Kagi (kagi.com)" in the available list of search engines, return to the previous step and perform more searches using Kagi.
