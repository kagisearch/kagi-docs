# Setting Kagi as Default on Safari (iPhone/iPad)

Use the [Orion iOS/iPadOS web browser](https://kagi.com/orion/), which has native support for Kagi Search.

If you prefer to use Safari, you can use the [Kagi Search for Safari extension](https://apps.apple.com/app/kagi-search-for-safari/id1622835804).

6. Tap the **AA** icon in the address bar and select **Kagi for Safari**.
7. If prompted with *The extension 'Kagi for Safari' would like to access kagi.com*, tap **Always Allow**, then confirm by tapping **Always Allow on Every Website**.

##### Choosing a Search Engine to Redirect (iOS) {#choosing_a_search_engine_to_redirect_ios}

By default, the Kagi Search extension for Safari will redirect searches from any search engine to Kagi. For a better experience, we recommend selecting a single search engine to redirect (DuckDuckGo or Ecosia are recommended options as they have better privacy policies than other alternatives). You can accomplish this by following these steps:

1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Tap on **Safari**.
3. Tap on **Search Engine**.
4. Select the search engine you want to redirect to Kagi (DuckDuckGo or Ecosia are recommended).
5. Open **Safari**.
6. Tap the **aA** or **puzzle piece** icon in the address bar.
7. Tap on **Kagi for Safari**.
8. In the **Engine to redirect** dropdown, select the same search engine you chose in step 4.
9. Tap on **Done**.

**Note:** If you set DuckDuckGo as default and experience issues with [Bangs](../../features/bangs.md) we recommend switching to Ecosia instead.
