## Choosing a Search Engine to Redirect (Mac) {#choosing_a_search_engine_to_redirect_mac}

By default, the Kagi Search extension for Safari will redirect searches from any search engine to Kagi. For a better experience, we recommend selecting a single search engine to redirect (DuckDuckGo or Ecosia are recommended options as they have better privacy policies than other alternatives). You can accomplish this by following these steps:

1. Open **Safari**.
2. In the menu bar, go to **Safari** > **Settings**.
3. Click on the **Search** tab.
4. In the **Search engine** dropdown, select the search engine you want to redirect to Kagi (DuckDuckGo or Ecosia are recommended).
5. Close the Settings window.
6. In Safari’s toolbar, click on the **Kagi extension icon**.
7. In the **Engine to redirect** dropdown, select the same search engine you chose in step 4.

**Note:** If you set DuckDuckGo as default and experience issues with [Bangs](../../features/bangs.md), we recommend switching to Ecosia instead.
