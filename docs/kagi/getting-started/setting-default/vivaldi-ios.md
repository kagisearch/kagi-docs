# Setting Kagi as the default search engine on Vivaldi on iOS

Vivaldi does not currently support adding custom search engines on iOS.
However, their documentation mentions that it should be possible to add Kagi as a custom engine on their **Desktop** version and then use their sync to add it to the iOS version.

See [setting Kagi as the default Search engine in Vivaldi desktop](./vivaldi-desktop.md) for futher instructions.
