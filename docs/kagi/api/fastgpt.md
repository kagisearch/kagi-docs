# FastGPT

[FastGPT](https://labs.kagi.com/fastgpt) is a Kagi service using powerful LLMs to answer user queries running a full search engine underneath. Think ChatGPT, but on steroids and faster! You can try the web app [here](https://labs.kagi.com/fastgpt).

## Quick start

1. Get the [API key](https://kagi.com/settings?p=api) (requires a Kagi account)
2. Top off your [API credits](https://kagi.com/settings?p=billing_api).
3. Call the API. See [example usage](#examples).

## API key

To obtain an API key you will first need to [create a Kagi account](https://kagi.com/signup?plan_id=trial). 

Then, navigate to Settings -> Advanced -> API portal, or click [here](https://kagi.com/settings?p=api) to go directly.

Click "Generate API Token".

## API Credits

The FastGPT API uses pre-paid API credits.
You can manage API credits in the [API billing](https://kagi.com/settings?p=billing_api) page of your Kagi settings.

Using API with insufficient credits will produce "Insufficient credit to perform this request." response message.

## Pricing

Pricing for FastGPT is a flat rate  per-query:

- 1.5¢ per query ($15 USD per 1000 queries) when `web_search` is enabled.
- 0.15¢ per query ($1.5 USD per 1000 queries) when `web_search` is disabled.

Cached responses, as with all [other Kagi APIs](./overview.md), are free.
