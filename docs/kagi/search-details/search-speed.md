# Search Speed

We’re obsessed with increasing speed and lowering latency, and we currently use three approaches.

First, we optimized our technology stack to increase code execution speed and decrease connection latency.

Second, we reduced data transfer between Kagi and the browser, in some cases as much as 20x less compared to some of our competitors! This reduction has the neat side-effect of reducing CO2 emissions. Using Kagi Search will benefit the environment as well as you!

| Product | SERP Size | CO2 | Load Time |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Kagi | 0.76 MB | 0.43 g | 0.4 s |
| Ecosia | 1.55 MB | 0.89 g | 1.2 s |
| Bing | 1.94 MB | 1.11 g | 0.8 s |
| Google | 2.43 MB | 1.39 g | 2.4 s |
| DuckDuckGo | 2.48 MB | 1.42 g | 2.1 s |

Third, our infrastructure is global, so you’ll always connect automatically to the Kagi node closest to you.
