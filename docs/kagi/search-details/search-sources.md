# Search Sources

Kagi is known for delivering a unique flavor of high-quality search results, sourced from our own web index (internally named "Teclis") and news index (internally named "TinyGem"). Kagi's indexes provide distinctive results that help you discover non-commercial websites and engage with "[small web](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web)" discussions surrounding a particular topic.

We don't stop there; we are always trying new things to surface relevant, high-quality results. For example, we recently launched the [Kagi Small Web](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web) initiative, which showcases content from personal blogs and discussions around the web. Discovering high-quality content written without the motive of financial gain gives Kagi's search results a unique flavor and makes it feel more humane to use.

Our search results also include anonymized API calls to all major search result providers worldwide, specialized search engines like [Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu), and sources of vertical information such as Wolfram Alpha, Apple, Wikipedia, Open Meteo, Yelp, TripAdvisor, and other APIs. Typically, every search query on Kagi will call a dozen or so different sources simultaneously, all with the purpose of bringing the best possible search results to the user in a split second.

Our unique algorithms down-rank pages with a lot of ads and trackers (which we have found correlate with a decrease in content quality) and promote content from independent, ad-free sources and personal websites. This ensures that Kagi shows results that delight users and are [worth paying for](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/why-pay-for-search.html). Subscriptions from our members pay for search results, allowing Kagi to remain [ad-free](https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over) and [100% privacy-respecting](https://kagi.com/privacy).

# Sources are not everything, incentives matter too

Why do Kagi's search results stand out even though other search engines have access to the same sources? The main reasons are:

**Kagi focuses on users, not advertisers**: This user-centric approach significantly enhances our ability to highlight high-quality search results. For instance, we effectively mitigate SEO spam by down-ranking websites reliant on ads or trackers. Since these spam websites predominantly monetize through ads, they become easily detectable. Our consistent strategy of combating ads in all forms prioritizes high-quality web results.  Kagi is demonstrating to the world that solid web search is possible and that [bad search results are a choice](https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/) made by legacy, ad-supported search engines.

**Innovative search experience**: Product features such as [promoting and blocking domains](../features/website-info-personalized-results.md) allow users to be in control of their search feed. The most promoted and blocked domains among Kagi users can be seen [in Kagi Stats](https://kagi.com/stats?stat=leaderboard).

With [Search Lenses](../features/lenses.md), users can explore search results from a subset of the web, for example, their favorite hobby or work-related websites.
With [Quick Answers](../ai/quick-answer.md), users can get a brief summary of the search results, and [Summarize Page](../ai/summarize-page.md) allows Kagi users to summarize any result (even a YouTube video!).



**Superior default algorithmic results**: Many users find Kagi's default search results to be unparalleled in quality. This stems from our unrelenting pursuit of the finest results from all available sources, regardless of the cost. We call upon multiple, diverse information sources for each search. We know that our members care about always getting the best search results possible, and they are ready to pay for that. 

If you cannot find something on Kagi, you likely cannot find it anywhere.

**Unique results from our own indexes (Teclis and TinyGem)**: Our in-house indexes help us uncover high-quality content from blogs and "small web" discussions, typically without ads and tracking. This specific approach lends Kagi results a more human, relatable flavor, distinguishing us from other search engines. 

We are also offering these results as an [API](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/enrich.html).
