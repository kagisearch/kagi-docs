# Security

The security of Kagi's systems and data is our highest priority.

We have had our security [independently audited](https://blog.kagi.com/security-audit) by [Illumant](https://www.illumant.com).

The audit found Kagi to be "Highly Secure" with "…no findings of material significance. This indicates that the organization’s applications, systems, networks and data are well protected."

If you discover a potential security issue on our platform, please notify our [security contact](mailto:vlad@kagi.com) immediately.
