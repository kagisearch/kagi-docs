# Private Browser Sessions Login Token

The simplest way to use Kagi in a private browser session is to install one of our [browser extensions](../getting-started/setting-default.md#browser_extension) and then add your Session Link to the extension.

You can also use the Session Link to manually run a Kagi search in environments where you are not logged in. 

A Session Link is a special Kagi URL that contains a "login token." You can use a Session Link to automatically log into your existing Kagi session from anywhere, including within private browser sessions. You can visit your [Account settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=user_details) to get your Session Link.

Because a Session Link provides access to your Kagi account, it should always be kept private. Never share your Session Link with others.

A Session Link is attached to the Kagi session it was copied from. You can Sign Out of that Kagi session if you need to invalidate the Session Link for any reason. Click the icon in the upper-right corner of a kagi.com webpage to open the Control Center. Then, use the **Sign Out** button in the lower-right corner of the screen.
