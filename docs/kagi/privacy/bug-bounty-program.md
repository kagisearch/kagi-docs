## Program Guidelines

1. You must use your own Kagi account when researching bugs.
2. Using third-party accounts without consent is strictly prohibited.
3. Manual testing only. Automated scanning tools are not permitted
4. Bugs and security concerns should be addressed to security@kagi.com
5. You should be the first person to report the bug to be entitled for a reward.
6. Compensation will be based on the severity of the bug finding.
7. Bug Bounty rewards will be paid by PayPal or Wise in U.S. dollars after the bug is fixed.
8. Security research should follow industry standards, and no legal actions should be initiated against
security researchers as long as they comply with this policy and guidelines.
