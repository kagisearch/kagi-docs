# Bug Bounty Program

## Program Guidelines

1. You must use your own Kagi account when researching bugs.
2. Using third-party accounts without consent is strictly prohibited.
3. Manual testing only. Automated scanning tools are not permitted
4. Bugs and security concerns should be addressed to security@kagi.com
5. You should be the first person to report the bug to be entitled for a reward.
6. Compensation will be based on the severity of the bug finding.
7. Bug Bounty rewards will be paid by PayPal in U.S. dollars after the bug is fixed.
Security research should follow industry standards, and no legal actions should be initiated against
security researchers as long as they comply with this policy and guidelines.


## Bounty Process

### Initial Report Submission

All security vulnerabilities must be reported to security@kagi.com with the following mandatory components:

- Detailed step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Technical description of the vulnerability
- Affected URLs, parameters, or endpoints
- Impact assessment and potential exploitation scenarios
- Environment details (browser, OS, etc.)


### Required Evidence

Your submission must include:

- Clear visual documentation (choose at least one):
  - Screenshots of the vulnerability
  - Screen recordings demonstrating the exploit
  - GIF demonstrations of the issue
  - Proof of concept code (if applicable)


### Validation Requirements

Before submission, ensure:

- The vulnerability is reproducible in a clean environment
- Multiple successful test confirmations are completed
- The issue is not related to cached data Tests are performed across different conditions to confirm consistency


### Review Process

Our security team will:

1. Acknowledge receipt within 24-48 hours
2. Perform initial triage to verify:
- Uniqueness of the report
- Current fix status
- Reproduction of the issue
3. Assess severity level according to the reward matrix
4. Communicate the assessed reward amount
5. Provide regular updates on fix progress


### Resolution & Reward

Upon successful resolution:

- Confirmation of fix implementation
- Verification request sent to reporter
- PayPal payment is processed after fixed verification
- Case closure notification sent


## Reward Matrix

Bounty rewards are subject to assessment, depending on the severity of the report and the impact on users.
