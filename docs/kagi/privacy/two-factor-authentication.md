# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

One of the best ways to protect your Kagi account is to set up two-factor authentication (2FA), this allows you to use an authenticator app to generate a verification code that will be requested every time you sign in to your account.

In the event that your account password was compromised, attackers wouldn’t be able to log in to your account as they would be required to enter the verification code generated by your authenticator app.

## Authenticator Apps

Kagi’s 2FA implementation is compatible with most authenticator apps, some options are provided below:  
iOS:
- [Raivo Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/raivo-authenticator/id1459042137)  
- [Google Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)  
- [Microsoft Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-authenticator/id983156458)  

Android:
- [Aegis Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beemdevelopment.aegis&hl=en&gl=US)
- [Google Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en&gl=US)
- [Microsoft Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.azure.authenticator&hl=en&gl=US)

Some password managers such as 1Password and Bitwarden also have a 2FA authenticator built-in.

If you are using a desktop app to generate the verification codes, then it might be easier to copy your setup key and paste it in your authenticator app directly.

As a way to prevent from being locked out from your account, we recommend you download and store your backup codes safely, these can be used to regain access to your account if you lose access to your authenticator app.
