# Bangs

Bangs are shortcuts starting with exclamation points (!) that quickly take you to search results on other sites. For example, searching Kagi for **!w Monty Python** will search Wikipedia directly for "Monty Python" and take you to that Wikipedia search result.

To take advantage of Bangs make sure you have enabled Bangs in your [Search](https://kagi.com/settings?p=search) settings. You can also set up Quick Bangs and Custom Bangs, continue reading to learn more.
