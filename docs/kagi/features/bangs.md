# Bangs

Bangs are shortcuts starting with exclamation points (!) that quickly take you to search results on other sites. For example, searching Kagi for **!w Monty Python** will search Wikipedia directly for "Monty Python" and take you to that Wikipedia search result. Bangs that perform searches on external sites are [never counted as searches](../plans/plan-types.md#how-searches-are-counted) for the purpose of billing/usage.

![Bang Example](media/bang.gif){data-zoomable}

To take advantage of Bangs make sure you have enabled Bangs in your [Search](https://kagi.com/settings?p=search) settings. You can also set up Quick Bangs and Custom Bangs, continue reading to learn more.

You can use the community-created [Kagi Bangs Explorer](https://kbe.smaertness.net) to find bangs for your favorite sites.

## Bang Examples

Some of the more popular search bangs include:

- **!help** \<query> to search this knowledge base for information about Kagi Search. Try "!help search operators" in Kagi.
- **!i** \<query> for Kagi Images
- **!m** \<query> for Kagi Maps
- **!n** \<query> for Kagi News
- **!v** \<query> for Kagi Videos
- **!** \<query> to go directly to the first result for your query in Kagi Search

### Regional bangs

You can quickly search in another region than your default by using a bang with that region's country code.

For example:

- `!de` to search in Germany
- `!nl` to search in Netherlands
- `!int` to search with the International setting

This will load search results with that region already selected in the region filter, instead of needing to perform a search first.

For convenience, Kagi supports placing the bang trigger elsewhere in your query.

Here is the full list of patterns that we support:

- `!g query`
- `g! query`
