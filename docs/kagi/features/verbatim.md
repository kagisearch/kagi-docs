# Verbatim Search

Kagi will return "All Results" to a search based on the default settings as seen below.

You may further filter results by choosing to perform a "Verbatim Search".

"Verbatim Search" searches for the exact phrase you type in the search box. As an example, "What is a podcast" will normally find you many pages that discuss the definition of a podcast. But, in "Verbatim Search", this will only find pages with the specific phrase quoted verbatim in it. It wont even find pages that say "What's a podcast".

This can be a very useful tool to search for specific content; it can also significantly cut down the number of results: so much so that Kagi will remind you that you have Verbatim selected if your search phrase finds nothing at all. 

You can select "Verbatim Search" by expanding the "All Results" drop down.

Once this option is set it will stay enabled until you "Clear" the filter.
