Kagi allows you to filter your results in ways you won't find on other search engines:

- **Region** (examples: International, United States, Turkey)
- **Order By**
  - Default, Recency, Website, or Ad/Trackers Count
  - `Most relevant first` or `Least relevant first`
- **Time**
  - All, Past 24 Hours, Past Week, Past Month, or Past Year
  - From Date until To Date
- **Verbatim** and **Personalized** results
  - You can view results containing the specific text you searched for or temporarily turn off [Personalized search results](./website-info-personalized-results.md).
