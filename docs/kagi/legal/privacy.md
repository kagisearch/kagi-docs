# Privacy Rights Addendum

This addendum is part of [Kagi's Privacy Policy](https://kagi.com/privacy). If there's any conflict between this addendum and the main policy, this addendum takes precedence for data protection matters.

## Children's Privacy

Our services aren't intended for children under 16 years of age (under 13 in the United States). We don't knowingly collect personal information from children.

If we learn we've collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we'll delete that information immediately. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child, please contact us at privacy@kagi.com.

## International Data Transfers

Kagi is based in the United States. If you're accessing our services from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located.

By using our services, you acknowledge this transfer. We handle all data the same way, following this Privacy Policy regardless of where it originates.

## Your Privacy Rights

Whether you're in the EU (GDPR), UK, California (CCPA/CPRA), or one of the growing number of US states with privacy laws, you have rights over your data. We extend these rights to all users, everywhere, even where not legally required.

States with privacy laws include: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia.

### Do We Sell Your Data?

### What Personal Information Do We Collect?

We collect these categories of personal information:

* **Identifiers:** Email address, account credentials  
* **Commercial Information:** Subscription plan, payment records (held by our payment processors)  
* **Internet Activity:** Temporary debugging logs (7-90 days retention)

What we don't collect: We don't store your search queries (beyond temporary 7-day debugging logs), don't track which results you click, and don't build user profiles.

### How We Use Your Data

* Providing search services  
* Processing payments  
* Customer support  
* Service improvement and debugging

## The Details

### Access (Right to Know)

You can request to know what personal data we hold about you. Given Kagi's privacy-first design, this typically includes:

* Your account email address  
* Payment information (held by our processors: Stripe, Reach, PayPal, OpenNode)  
* Subscription plan details  
* Usage volume for billing purposes

### Correction (Rectification)

You can correct any inaccurate personal information. Most information can be updated directly in your account settings at kagi.com/settings. For other corrections, contact privacy@kagi.com.

### Delete (Erasure/Right to Be Forgotten)

You can request deletion of your personal data. We'll delete everything except:

* Records we're legally required to keep (such as tax documentation)  
* Information needed to prevent fraud or resolve disputes

### Portability

You can request your personal data in a machine-readable format (JSON or CSV) to transfer to another service provider. You'll receive your account details, subscription information, and preferences. As noted above, we don't store search history or behavioral data.

### Restrict Processing

You can ask us to limit how we process your data while we:

* Verify the accuracy of your data  
* Assess your objection to processing  
* Determine the lawfulness of processing

### Object / Opt-Out

You can object to processing based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing. Given our business model (you pay us, we serve you), we don't engage in behavioral advertising or sell your data, so this right is rarely applicable.

### Withdraw Consent

Where we process data based on your consent, you can withdraw it at any time. This won't affect processing that occurred before withdrawal.

### Limit Use of Sensitive Information

Not applicable. We don't collect sensitive personal information as defined by privacy laws (CCPA, GDPR).

### No Discrimination

We won't penalize you for exercising your privacy rights. Your service level, pricing, and features remain unchanged.

### Lodge a Complaint

If you believe we've mishandled your data, you can file a complaint with a supervisory authority:

* **EU/EEA residents:** Your national data protection authority  
* **UK residents:** Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) at ico.org.uk  
* **California residents:** California Attorney General at oag.ca.gov  
* **Other US states:** Your state attorney general

You can also contact us first at privacy@kagi.com, and we'll work to resolve your concern.

**Email:** privacy@kagi.com  
**Subject:** \[Your Right\] Request (for example: "Access Request")

**Include in your request:**

* The email address associated with your Kagi account

### Authorized Agents

You may designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. We may require verification of the agent's authority.

### Identity Verification

To protect your privacy, we may ask you to verify your identity before processing requests. This typically involves confirming details about your account. We'll never ask for your password.

## Why We Process Your Data

We process data based on:

* **Contract:** Necessary to provide the search service you are paying for  
* **Legal Obligation:** Required to retain certain billing records as mandated by tax law  
* **Legitimate Interest:** Temporary request logging for debugging to maintain service quality

### Limitations

In rare cases, we may be unable to fully comply with a request due to:

* Legal obligations (such as tax record retention)  
* Establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims  
* Technical limitations (data already permanently deleted)

If we can't fulfill your request, we'll explain why and inform you of your right to complain to a supervisory authority.

### No Fees

We don't charge fees to process data rights requests unless they're manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.

### Do Not Track Signals

We don't respond to browser "Do Not Track" signals, as there's no consistent industry standard for compliance. However, this isn't relevant to your privacy at Kagi because we don't track you in the first place. We don't track you across websites, don't use third-party tracking technologies, and don't participate in cross-site tracking.

## California Shine the Light Law

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Kagi does not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and have questions about this, you may contact us at privacy@kagi.com.
