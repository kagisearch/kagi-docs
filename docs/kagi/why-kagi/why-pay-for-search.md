# The real cost of "free" search

Everyone pays for search. The difference is whether you're paying with your attention, time, and private data - or with your wallet.

## The hidden price tag

In 2022, advertisers spent **$185.35 billion** to influence your search results. By 2028, they'll spend **$261 billion**. This isn't just numbers - it's an arms race for your attention.

Every dollar spent makes your search results:
- More cluttered with ads
- Harder to navigate
- Slower to deliver answers
- More privacy-invasive

## The warning we ignored

> "**The goals of the advertising business model do not always correspond to providing quality search to users... advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.**"
>
> 
> — [The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine](http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf), Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page, 1998

They predicted this crisis. Then Google transformed from organizing the world's information to organizing the world's ads. The result? A [great deterioration of web and search](https://dkb.io/post/DEPR_google-search-is-dying) that affects us all.


## The true cost in numbers

Let's be crystal clear about what "free" really costs:
- Google generated **$76 billion** in US ad revenue (2023)
- They make **$277 per user** annually in the US
- That's **$23 per month** someone pays to influence your results
- Your attention is literally being auctioned to the highest bidder

**Google is only "free" if your time has no value.** Every ad, every clickbait result, every distraction steals minutes of your life you'll never get back.
