# Assistant

Kagi Assistant is a product feature backed by Kagi Search and large language models.

> Kagi Assistant is currently in open beta only available to Ultimate plan members.

## Assistant Modes

### Research

Research assistant uses Kagi search and external sources like Wolfram Alpha, together with an AI model to answer your queries.
This model also allows you to upload a file (up to 8 MB) or provide a URL (article, PDF, video, podcast, etc.) to use as context.
If an image is provided it will be processed using GPT4 Vision.

This mode is available in two variants:

- `Fast`: Kagi search coupled with a fast LLM (`claude-instant`). Optimized for speed, while not sacrificing quality. Access directly with the `!fast` bang.
- `Expert`: Multiple Kagi searches (and external services) together with the best available LLM (`claude-2`) for the highest accuracy and comprehensive responses. Access directly with the `!expert` bang.

### Code

Code assistant is tuned for programming tasks and uses a powerful AI model for programming.
