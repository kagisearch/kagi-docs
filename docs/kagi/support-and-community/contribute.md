# Contribute

The Kagi user community is a vibrant, diverse, and passionate group that plays a vital role in enhancing the Kagi platform. We value each contribution that helps make Kagi better. Here are several ways you can contribute:

- **Spread the word**: The simplest yet most impactful way to contribute is by spreading the word about Kagi. Share your positive experiences with friends, family, and your social circle. Assist others in setting up Kagi, and consider gifting [Kagi gift cards](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/gift-kagi.html) on special occasions.
