# Discord Server

We have a [Kagi Community Discord server](https://kagi.com/discord) where users of our privacy respecting search engine, Kagi, and browser, Orion, can provide general feedback and directly communicate with our community.

Please use the **#introduce-yourself** channel to say hello and let everyone know a bit about you.

We'd also love to hear your thoughts about Kagi in **#kagi-chat**.

To make specific feature requests or bug reports, please use our [Kagi Search feedback forum](https://kagifeedback.org) rather than Discord.
