# Community roles
From day one, Kagi and Orion have been shaped by people who file thoughtful bug reports, suggest features, translate the UI, or simply help other users.
To recognize and reward that energy, we created **two community roles**: **Contributor** and **Distinguished Member**, each with its own set of perks.

## Contributor

### Eligibility
Earn **25 points** on either [Kagi Feedback](https://kagifeedback.org/) or [Orion Feedback](https://orionfeedback.org/). Points come from community reactions to your posts, bug reports, and feature suggestions (see [How points work](#how-points-work) below).

### Perks
- **Contributor role** in the [Kagi Community Discord server](https://kagi.com/discord)
- Access to **Contributor-only channels**
- **Contributor badge** next to your name in the feedback forum where you earned the points
- **Early access** to upcoming features and experiments

## Distinguished Member

### Eligibility
You can qualify in two ways. Either accumulate **150 points** on the feedback forums or make a **major contribution to the product**—for example, [translating a product](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/support-and-community/contribute_translations.html) into a new language or creating an impactful [community add-on](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/community-addons/index.html). 

### Perks
- **Distinguished Member role** in the [Kagi Community Discord](https://kagi.com/discord)
- Access to **VIP and Contributor channels**
- **Distinguished Member badge** in the feedback forum where you qualified
- **First-in-line** access to brand-new features and experiments

## How points work

Forum points measure how much the community values your input. You receive them when you:

- Post a new bug report or feature idea
- Get an upvote on any submission
- Receive a “Like” on a comment or reply
