## Kagi Community

We have a [Kagi Community Discord server](https://kagi.com/discord) where you can join our community for real-time discussion about the product and chat with other Kagi users.

Please use the **#introduce-yourself** channel to say hello and let everyone know a bit about yourself.
You can also share your initial thoughts on Kagi search in this channel or create a more detailed post in the **#kagi-chat** channel.

We are always eager to hear what new users think of Kagi.

To make specific feature requests or bug reports, please use our [Kagi Search feedback forum](https://kagifeedback.org) rather than Discord.
