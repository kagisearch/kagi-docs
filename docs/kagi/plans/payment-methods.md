## Using PayPal and OpenNode with Kagi

PayPal and OpenNode can only be used to [add prepaid funds](https://kagi.com/settings/account_topup) to your Kagi account, which can then be used towards any of our plans.  
If you added prepaid funds and haven't subscribed to one of our plans yet, you can do so from the [Plan Selection](https://kagi.com/settings/billing_plan) page.

After choosing your plan, you will be redirected to Stripe to confirm your subscription. This is required because we use Stripe to manage all subscriptions, regardless of the payment method used.

If you have any questions about our payment methods or need help with your subscription, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team at [support@kagi.com](mailto:support@kagi.com).
