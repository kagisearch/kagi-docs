# Plan Types

Kagi offers several subscriptions plans.

![Pricing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/527749da-522d-4f1f-9d59-0d05e3867808){data-zoomable}

### Individual:
* The **Trial** plan is limited to 100 total searches. This plan is suited for those interested in exploring Kagi and curious about paid search engines.
* The **Starter** plan offers 300 searches for USD $5 per month. This plan is suited for users who are new to paid search engines and are looking to own their search experience.
* The **Professional** plan offers unlimited searches for USD $10 per month. This plan is suited for internet professionals and developers who are prolific and advanced search users.
* The [**Ultimate**](./ultimate-plan.md) plan offers unlimited searches and access to [The Assistant](../ai/assistant.md) for USD $25 per month. This plan offers the most power to the user.

### Family Plan:

We offer [Family plans](./family-plan.md) for two or more people. If you have a Family or Duo plan, you can upgrade family members to the Ultimate plan features from the [Family Members](https://kagi.com/settings?p=account_members) page for an additional $15 per month, per upgraded family member.

### Team Plan:

You can also bring Kagi to your organization with our [Team plan](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/plans/team-plan.html)! See how [Kagi for Teams](https://kagi.com/teams) can elevate your whole workspace with powerful search features and universal AI access, while keeping your organization's data private and secure.

## How searches are counted

* [Bangs](../features/bangs.md) and search suggestions (while typing) are never counted as searches.
* Reloading the same search within a short time (~2 minutes) does not count as an additional search.
* Each [lens](../features/lenses.md) and content type (e.g. images, news) is considered a separate search.
* Loading more results counts as an additional search.

Note that searches do not roll over to the next month; the number of available searches resets each month. Months are counted starting from the date of subscription, and are not necessarily aligned with the months of the year.

## Legacy Subscribers and Early Adopters

For any existing subscribers and early adopters who are interested in how legacy accounts will be used and maintained please refer to the blog post [Unlimited Kagi searches for $10 per month](https://blog.kagi.com/unlimited-searches-for-10).

## Why Tiered Pricing

This tiered pricing system is easy to understand and ensures Kagiâ€™s financial sustainability for the future so that we can continue to provide you with the tools to own your search experience as we pursue our mission to humanize the web.

## Pick The Right Plan

### Start Simple

We understand picking the right plan can be challenging and while we have expertise in this area and are prepared to help we suggest starting with the simple Starter plan. It is very unlikely you will exceed the allotted searches for this plan unless you are in the top 1% of searching users. To be in the top 1% you would likely need to depend on search on a daily basis for your livelihood. As a reminder the Starter plan is USD $5/month with 300 searches included.

### Upgrade to Unlimited Searches

If you find that you are consistently running out of searches at the end of each month because you have the Starter plan and need more than 300 searches it is time to consider the Professional plan. This plan is priced at USD $10/month and you get unlimited searches!

### Consider the Ultimate Plan for Advanced Features

If you are interested in taking advantage of all the advanced features that Kagi is building then it is time to upgrade to the Ultimate plan. This gives you access to exclusive and early access to Kagi features and services.
  * Note: Ultimate Plan users have access to the open beta of the [next generation of tools](../ai/assistant.md) that Kagi is bringing to the web.

### Understand Your Consumption

Kagi has a feature to check your [current search usage](https://kagi.com/settings?p=consumption) if you are interested in really taking apart your consumption.

### Fair Pricing

In months where you don't utilize any searches on your plan, we will automatically apply a full credit to your account for that month. This credit will be applied to your next billing cycle, effectively covering your subsequent month's subscription at no additional cost.
