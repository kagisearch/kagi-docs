# About

Kagi Inc. is a company created with the mission to humanize the web. Our goal is to amplify the web of human knowledge, creativity, and self-expression.

Kagi was founded in 2018 by [Vladimir Prelovac](https://vladimir.prelovac.com/) in Palo Alto, CA (USA). Kagi's advisory board consists of [Raghu Murthi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghumurthi) and [Dr. Norman Winarsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Winarsky). Our team is a fully remote team operating on all continents.

Kagi has been bootstrapped by the founder from 2018 to 2023. In 2023, [Kagi raised $670K](https://blog.kagi.com/safe-round) from Kagi members in its first external fundraise.

Kagi Inc. currently has two products: [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com), a fast, private search engine, and [Orion Browser](https://browser.kagi.com/), a fast, zero-telemetry browser.

## What Does "Kagi" Mean?

The word "kagi" means "key" in Japanese.

Kagi is pronounced as kah-gee. You can [listen to the pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig4VTr0rt4Q).

## Kagi Search Logo

More Kagi assets are available on the [Kagi Assets](https://kagi.com/assets) page.

People sometimes ask: why does Kagi have a "g" logo in the Google ballpark rather than a "k"?

Our designer insisted the Kagi logo is "anchored" in the letter "g," and we had to agree. Besides, we can't let Google own the letter "g" too, can we? ;)

## Orion Browser Logo

## Who is Kagi's Mascot?

We simply call him ”Doggo” for now. He's adorable!
