## The logo is a "g" which is in the Google ballpark. Why not "k"?

Our designer insisted that Kagi logo is "anchored" in the letter "g" and we had to agree. Besides, can't let Google own letter "g" too, can we? ;)

## Can I use Kagi in private browser sessions? {#using-login-token}

Yes, Kagi features a 'login token' which is simply a URL parameter that you can use to automatically log you into your existing Kagi session, from anywhere, including using search within private browser sessions. You can visit [Account settings](https://kagi.com/settings?p=user_details) to get your login token.

This token is attached to the session it was copied from. You can log out of that session if you need to invalidate it for any reason.

You can use private session token manually, or through [Kagi browser extensions](../getting-started/setting-default.md).

## Why does Kagi Search require an account?

Kagi Search requires an account only because it is a paid service which requires an account for the transaction.

Note that Kagi does not collect any personal information for billing and that you can even use an anonymous payment card such as PrivacyHQ if you want to.

## Why does Kagi Search require an email address?

We require an email address to be able to verify the account really belongs to you in the following cases:

- To handle the account recovery (in case you lose your password)
- In case you contact us via email with an account related questions (in particular requests to delete your account or change your subscription)
- To occasionaly send product updates, which you can disable in your Kagi settings or unsubscribe directly from the email

Note that you can use an anonymous email provider such as SimpleLogin with Kagi Search and it is up to you what email address you want to use.

Kagi does need your personal information and the above requirements are just bare minimums needed in order to be able to operate a subscription product business.

## I have privacy concerns over linking my search queries with my credit card. Why should I trust you?

We do not log search queries. Queries you type are never associated with your account. The simple reason is we don't have any reason to do so, as it would only be a liability for us. We are in the business of selling search results, not user data.

You can also check our [privacy policy](https://kagi.com/privacy) for more information.

## What data does Kagi collect?

Only bare necessities to run the service. Please see our [privacy policy](https://kagi.com/privacy) and our documentation about [privacy protection](../privacy/privacy-protection.md) for more information.

## Where are your results coming from?

Please refer to [Kagi search sources](../search-details/search-sources.md).

## How fast is Kagi Search?

We are...ahem...[fast](../search-details/search-speed.md).

## How do Kagi's features compare to other search engines?

Kagi has [key features](../why-kagi/kagi-vs-competition.md) you won't find in other search engines.

## How are searches counted?

- [Bangs](../features/bangs.md) and search suggestions (while typing) are never counted as searches.
- Reloading the same search within a short time (~2 minutes) does not count as an additional search.
- Each [lense](../features/lenses.md) and content type (e.g. images, news) is considered a separate search.
- Loading more results counts as an additional search.

## Why is Kagi focusing on AI and Orion Browser as well?

Kagi has zero marketing budget and spends zero on marketing, we see Orion and AI as customer acquisition channels for Kagi. Orion is already providing about 20% of our customers, people find Orion first and then find out about Kagi. Instead of spending money on marketing we are spending money on the products because we want to holistically solve the problem of consuming information on the web, not just search. There is a wonderful synergy between Orion and Kagi as well as the Universal Summarizer technology that we are investing in.

## How do you balance development of AI features and Search?

Kagi is in the business of search, not in the business of selling AI, our philosophy is that AI is there to enhance the experience, not create it. We are excited by the possibilities that AI will bring - the initial demonstration shows the expansion of search backed by AI, for example the ability to chat with any document on the web. And currently only 10% of searches that can be made are actually being made, which is because current engines cannot cover the remaining 90%.

## Will you expose the Search API?

Check our currently available [APIs](../api/overview.md).

## How do I check my usage?

You can check your usage [here](https://kagi.com/settings?p=consumption). This can also be accessed by clicking Check Usage from the Settings -> Billing page.

## How can I change the name or other billing details that my subscription is being billed to?

Go to Kagi Settings -> Billing (or click [here](https://kagi.com/settings?p=billing)) and then click "Manage Billing".

This will bring you to the billing portal where you are able to update your billing information.

## What is your policy on biases in search?

We are very careful not to introduce a precedent with any type of non search quality related bias (including moral, political on any other type of bias). 

Some results from traditional sources we use may reflect inherent biases beyond our control.

What we maintain is a strict search-quality bias. We downrank web pages that contain ads and trackers, as this has emperically proven to improve search result quality for our members. 

We also empower our members with powerful tools like [domain preferences](../features/website-info-personalized-results.md) and [lenses](../features/lenses.md) to help them shape their search results in any way they prefer.

## How does Kagi help protect my privacy?
”Free” search engines have two ways to make money – get more users or sell more ads per user. The easiest, fastest way is to mine more data to sell ads more effectively. Many search-engine companies have buckled under investor pressure, leading us to the online privacy issues we have today.

Paid models like Kagi only make money when users pay us, and users only pay when they receive great value. We offer superior result quality, features, speed and of course privacy. If we compromise on any of these points, we lose users. Therefore we have to offer a better product that includes the best possible privacy.

We designed our product to give you a good answer and get you on your way instead of forcing you to wade through a swamp of results that have leeches lurking under the surface.

## What data does Kagi collect?
Only bare necessities to run the service. Please see our [privacy policy](https://kagi.com/privacy) for more information.

## I am still worried about my private information and searches being linked together. Why should I trust you?

Let us reiterate that we do not log searches or in any way tie them to an account. Our business model is to sell subscriptions, not user data.

While it is virtually impossible for us to prove that, nor it is impossible to charge for the service without people having an account, we simply have no incentive to do it.

Kagi’s business model is unlike any other search engine. This means we don’t need or want your personal information (it would just be an unwelcome liability). In fact the only data we take is the email address, which can be any email address really, as long as you can use it to recover your account. There is no other personal information shared with Kagi. By choosing this business model we know that we are going to have far less users than mainstream search engine for example, but we have also removed any incentive to misuse any information you have shared with us.



## Are you affiliated with the legendary Kagi shareware platform?

No. That Kagi went bankrupt in an unfortunate turn of events. We liked the name and acquired it when we got the chance.

## Are you hiring?

Yes, [see here](../company/hiring-kagi.md).


## What if I find a security issue?

If you discover potential security issues on our platform, please notify our [security contact](mailto:vlad@kagi.com).

## How do I join Kagi’s Discord server?

The Kagi beta Discord server is a great way to provide feedback and have direct communication with our team.

You can join this server at [kagi.com/discord](https://kagi.com/discord).

Feel free to chime in with your thoughts.

## Does Kagi have any student discounts?

We do not have any discounts because Kagi is not yet profitable and there is nothing to discount from.
