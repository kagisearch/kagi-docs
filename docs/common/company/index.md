# About

At Kagi, we envision a friendly version of the internet where users can explore, learn, and interact with confidence and ease. Our mission is to humanize the web, making it more accessible, ethical, and centered around the needs of individuals. We are driven by our core purpose: to inform and educate, empowering users with knowledge and understanding in their digital journey.

Kagi (pronounced kah-gee) was founded in 2018 by [Vladimir Prelovac](https://vladimir.prelovac.com/) in Palo Alto, CA (USA). Kagi's advisory board consists of [Raghu Murthi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghumurthi), [Dr. Norman Winarsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Winarsky), and [Stephen Wolfram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Wolfram). Our team is fully remote, operating in over 10 countries. We are actively [hiring](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company/hiring-kagi.html).

Kagi was bootstrapped from 2018 to 2023 with ~$3M initial funding from the founder. In 2023, [Kagi raised $670K](https://blog.kagi.com/safe-round) from Kagi users in its first external fundraise, followed by [$1.88M raised in 2024](https://blog.kagi.com/what-is-next-for-kagi#3), again from our users, bringing the number of users-investors to 93.

Kagi launched in [June 2022](https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-orion-public-beta) and we maintain a public page tracking real-time Kagi growth and usage statistics at [kagi.com/stats](https://kagi.com/stats).

In early 2024, [Kagi became a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)](https://blog.kagi.com/what-is-next-for-kagi#4). 

We want to bring a friendly version of the internet, one that has the user's best interest in mind, into homes and businesses worldwide with our portfolio of products.

Kagi currently has two core products: [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com), a fast, private search engine, and [Orion Browser](https://browser.kagi.com/), a fast, zero-telemetry, WebKit-based browser. 

We also have a number of other initiatives (we call them 'treats') such as:
- [Kagi Small Web](https://blog.kagi.com/small-web)
- [Universal Summarizer](https://kagi.com/summarizer)
- [FastGPT](https://kagi.com/fastgpt)
- [Open-source projects](https://github.com/kagisearch)
- [Kagi APIs](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/overview.html)
- [Kagi Translate](https://blog.kagi.com/kagi-translate)

Read about [Kagi's origin story](https://dkb.io/post/DEPR_kagi-interview) and [The Age of Pagerank is Over](https://blog.kagi.com/age-pagerank-over) blog post, which serves as our manifesto.

We hope that our work impacts people's lives in some small way for the better. Thank you for your interest in being a part of this!

## What Does "Kagi" Mean?

The word "kagi" means "key" in Japanese.

Kagi is pronounced as kah-gee. You can [listen to the pronunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig4VTr0rt4Q).

## Kagi Search Logo

More Kagi assets are available on the [Kagi Assets](https://kagi.com/assets) page.

People sometimes ask: why does Kagi have a "g" logo in the Google ballpark rather than a "k"?

Our brand designer insisted the Kagi logo is "anchored" in the letter "g," and we had to agree. Besides, we can't let Google own the letter "g" too, can we? ;)

## Orion Browser Logo

## Who is Kagi's Mascot?

We simply call him ”Doggo” for now. He's adorable! We have more [assets](https://kagi.com/assets) available.
