# History

Kagi was founded by [Vladimir Prelovac](https://vladimir.prelovac.com) in May 2018 in Palo Alto, CA (USA). Kagi has been completely bootstrapped by the founder for the first 4 years of operation.

We are not affiliated with the legendary Kagi - the shareware payments platform. That Kagi went bankrupt in an unfortunate turn of events. We liked the name and acquired it when we got the chance.
  
## Early years

In the first couple of years (2018 - 2019) Kagi was focused on AI technology, driven by the notion that any future search engine will need to have a strong instant question-answering component. We called it "[the last mile of search](https://kagi.ai/last-mile-for-web-search.html)" and this project gave us
the domain knowledge and expertise used in Kagi Search today. Other experiments like [video question answering](https://vimeo.com/754908681) were built during this period.

In 2019 the [first prototype of Kagi Search](https://vimeo.com/754899234) is made public. It used an unusual MUD-like, command-line mode with powerful features built in.  

First prototype of Orion browser with support for web extensions on iOS is made, giving us 'wings' to continue building the future best browser on Apple devices.
