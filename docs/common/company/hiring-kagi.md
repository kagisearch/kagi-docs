# Join Kagi

At Kagi, we're on a mission to humanize the web - making it more accessible, ethical, and centered around individual needs. Founded in 2018 by Vladimir Prelovac in Palo Alto, California, we've grown into a fully remote team of 40 people spanning over 20 countries. In early 2024, we proudly became a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), reinforcing our commitment to positive societal impact. You can read more about us [here](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/company).


## Why Kagi?
- Our core products include Kagi Search, an ad-free, private search engine, and Orion Browser, a privacy-focused WebKit-based browser for Mac, iOS and soon to be Linux that blocks ads and trackers by default.
- We provide a suite of ad-free search and AI assistant tools, customizable plans, and a commitment to keeping your organization's data private and secure.
- Our AI features are built to enhance rather than replace the search experience, and to support human capabilities without diminishing them. That's why our AI tools are designed to be opt-in and on-demand, keeping you in control. Read more about our AI philosophy [here](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/why-kagi/ai-philosophy.html). 
- Help build products that vastly improve how people, teams and families interact with the web daily.
