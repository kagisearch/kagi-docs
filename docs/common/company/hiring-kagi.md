# Jobs at Kagi Search

## Full-time positions

**Core Back-end Team**
- Advanced knowledge of the Crystal language. 
- Exceptional problem-solving and coding abilities.
- Crafting products with care

Our tech lead Zac Nowicki recently gave a talk at Crystal Conf. Zac shares a summary of lessons, technology, ideas, and challenges after building a search engine product from the ground up in Crystal for the past three years. Watch the presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7t9xPajjTM&list=PLt-CsM4G1WoadONHl3zPN_Ts5PqH8TgMZ&index=8).

**Core Front-end Team** (we are currently full, check back later)
- Passion for creating delightful and swift user interfaces. 
- Proficiency in HTML, CSS, and an understanding that JavaScript can be used sparingly to enhance, not create, product experiences.
- You are comfortable not using any FE frameworks, and rather like to be in full control of the DOM and as close to browser as possible.

Fun fact: At Kagi, we [prioritize speed](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/search-details/search-speed.html), to the point where all functionalities of Kagi Search (except Stripe checkout and Maps) work perfectly without JavaScript. We see JavaScript as a tool to enhance the UX, not create it. 

**Core ML Team**
- Deep understanding of machine learning tools and technologies, whether in the build/deploy or apply/customize layers.
- Demonstrable expertise with modern large language models (LLMs), their deployment and/or advanced prompting techniques.
- Experience in building noteworthy projects utilizing machine learning.

**Core Design Team** (we are currently full, check back later)
- Enthusiasm for diving deep into user feedback and discussions to improve UX.
- Meticulous attention to detail in UX design.
- A critical perspective on current search/assistant user interfaces, paired with a desire to revolutionize them.

**Product Manager - Search & Assistant**
- Clearly define goals and functionalities for features, set and validate outcome hypothesis, and write release notes
- Collaborate with the development team to efficiently deliver features, while continuously improving the team's processes, productivity, and accountability
- Demonstrate strong ownership by deeply understanding our objectives, forming a thoughtful perspective, and guiding development to achieve our mid to long-term goals
- Gather community feedback from various channels and convert it into actionable insights
- Communicate complex ideas in a clear manner, and promote engagement and collaboration in the team
- Previous experience leading products
  
**Chief of Staff**
-  Handling legal, finance, accounting, and HR to ensure day to-day operations are running smoothly.
-  Identifying areas of improvement across the organization, making actionable recommendations and executing them.
-  Completing special operational projects and initiatives with attention to detail. 
-  Has previous experience with operations in startups.
  
**General conditions**
- Flexible working conditions; remote first culture.
- Our journey is filled with exciting challenges and ever-evolving processes. It's a bit of a rollercoaster, not for the faint-hearted.
- Our ambition is enormous, going against industry giants with a very small team. You will work a lot.
- We are completely user funded. Kagi is currently used by [one town worth of people](https://kagi.com/stats). Do not expect VC backed/big-tech salary. Do expect equity as a part of compensation.

Send your CV to [hello@kagi.com](mailto:hello@kagi.com).  We’ll send a test project.

## Part-time opportunities

**Kagi R&D Team** (aka Kagi Labs)

We are deeply committed to fostering a culture of research and development (R&D) at Kagi. Many of our groundbreaking technologies such as the [Universal Summarizer](https://kagi.com/summarizer), [FastGPT](https://kagi.com/fastgpt) or [Small Web](https://kagi.com/smallweb) have their origins in our R&D initiatives. At any time we have 4-5 individuals working on R&D projects, with some eventually transitioning to full-time roles.

We are currently seeking full-stack developers who embody the following qualifications:

- Proficiency in backend development with Python, Ruby, or Node.js, paired with expertise in crafting frontend interfaces using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Ability to dedicate 20 hours per week to R&D projects.
- A proactive and self-organized working style, capable of thriving in a "fire & forget" mode.
- A passion for building innovative projects from the ground up.
- You can demonstrate a history of tinkering with product ideas/hacking projects together.

If you are eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects and grow with a dynamic team, we would be thrilled to hear from you.
