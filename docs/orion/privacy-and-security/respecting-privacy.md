# Respecting Privacy

Orion has no built-in telemetry, so it can never "phone home" and risk exposing your data. Orion is truly and verifiably a privacy-respecting browser, unlike those that offer only an illusion of privacy.
  
Most browsers regularly "phone home" dozens or even [hundreds](https://brave.com/popular-browsers-first-run/) of times. Each request poses a security risk, no matter what information it sends, by potentially exposing your IP address and your browser fingerprint. Telemetry can also inadvertently leak personally identifiable information or corporate intelligence.

The safest way to secure your private data is for your browser to be zero telemetry out of the box. Want to keep your information safe and private? Orion makes it possible!
