# Preventing Fingerprinting

Orion approaches this problem with the philosophy of "no fingerprinter running, no fingerprinting possible." This is because it is literally impossible to prevent fingerprinting from a sophisticated fingerprinter if one is ever allowed to run.   
  
Even a [simple JS/CSS-based fingerprinter](https://fingerprintjs.com/) will bypass 99% of the "protections" created by browsers, let alone something sophisticated such as [GPU fingerprinting](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researchers-use-gpu-fingerprinting-to-track-users-online/) or [audio driver fingerprinting](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/19/audio-fingerprinting-being-used-to-track-web-users-study-finds/). Literally, if JavaScript/CSS is allowed to run in your browser, and a fingerprinter runs on the page, your browser will be fingerprinted.  
  
So forget user agent/screen resolution/OS masking and other marketing talk used by browsers—this was maybe a thing 15 years ago, if ever. This does not protect you against sophisticated fingerprinters on the web.  
  
The only efficient protection against fingerprinting is what Orion is doing — preventing any fingerprinter from running in the first place. Orion is the only browser on the market that comes with full first-party and third-party ad and tracking script blocking, built-in by default, making sure invasive fingerprinters never run on the page.
