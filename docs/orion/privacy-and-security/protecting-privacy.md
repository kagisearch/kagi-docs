# Protecting Privacy

Web ads have steadily eroded the online experience with their layout crowding, page slowing, annoying pop-ups, and insidious malware.
Yet, most browsers do not block ads by default. Orion is different. 

It comes with a state-of-the-art ad and tracking blocker that blocks first-party and third-party scripts and requests.
That means that Orion always blocks all trackers by default.
We combined WebKit's Intelligent Tracking Protection with "Easy Privacy" and other lists, providing double protection. 

We use WebKit's content-blocking functionality and an optimized content-blocking database to maximize speed and minimize latency as well. Orion successfully blocks 99.9% of all ads, including YouTube ads, both on desktop and mobile.
