## Why Use Blocking?

Over [700 million devices block online ads](https://www.statista.com/statistics/435252/adblock-users-worldwide/), creating the largest silent protest in human history. We too believe in a cleaner, more humane web.   
  
Orion blocks both first-party and third-party ads, trackers, and other annoyances by default. We do this to make your online adventures more enjoyable and more private. It also saves you time, battery, and data. Yes, it may occasionally break a site, but in most cases the benefit outweighs the risk.

If you wish, you can disable blocking either for a specific website or globally.

## Websites Whitelisted From Blocking

Orion comes with a built-in content blocker that in rare cases can affect proper functionality of some websites. We maintain a whitelist of websites where content blocker will be turned off by default.

This list currently consists of:

-   browserbench.org - The content blocker interferes with JavaScript performance benchmarking. We decided it is best to have it off to measure the real speed of WebKit's JavaScript engine.
-   wizzair.com - The content blocker interferes with rendering of the website.

If you wish, you can enable blocking on any whitelisted website using the instructions above.
