# Welcome to the Orion User Guide!

Orion is a free, lightning-fast, privacy-focused WebKit-based browser for Mac, iOS and soon to be Linux that blocks ads and trackers by default. We're glad you're here!

**Please note that Orion Docs are in beta and thus are not yet complete.** We haven't documented all of Orion's amazing features yet. But, we will be adding more documentation here over time.

If you're new to Orion, our [Quick Start](./getting-started/quick-start.md) and [FAQ](./faq/faq.md) are great places to begin. Stay up to date with the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes by following [our release notes](https://kagi.com/orion/updates/orion-release-notes.html). We also encourage you to join our [feedback forums](https://orionfeedback.org/) to report bugs or share your feature suggestionsâ€”every submission is greatly appreciated!

You can access our documentation in several ways:

- Click or tap an article link from the list.
- Click or tap the magnifying glass icon at the top of the screen and do a search.
- Use the **!orion** [bang](../kagi/features/bangs.md) in [Kagi Search](https://kagi.com). For example, searching in Kagi for [!orion setting default search engine](https://kagi.com/search?q=!orion%20setting%20default%20search%20engine) will show you results containing our documentation on how to set Orion's default search engine.
 
Feedback about this Orion documentation can be shared on our [Discord server](https://kagi.com/discord) in the **\#documentation** channel. We would love to hear your thoughts on anything we can fix or improve.
