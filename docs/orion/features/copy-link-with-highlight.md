Orion's Copy Link with Highlight feature allows you to generate a shareable link that points to a specific section of a web page.
This is useful when you want to direct someone's attention to a particular passage or easily save a reference to it in your notes.

To use this feature:

1. Select the desired text on the web page.
2. Right-click and choose **Copy Link with Highlight** from the context menu.
3. The link is now copied to your clipboard, ready to be shared or saved.

When you or someone else opens the generated link, the web page will load with the originally selected text highlighted in yellow.
This makes it easy to locate the relevant section of the page.

The links with highlights that you generate can be shared with people using Orion, Safari, Google Chrome, and other Chromium-based browsers such as Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Vivaldi.
You can also open links with highlights generated in these browsers.

Give it a try the next time you need to share or save a link to a specific part of a web page.
This handy feature can save time and make collaboration easier.
