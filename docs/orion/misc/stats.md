# Live stats

Orion is a zero telemetry browser and we do not know the actual number of users using it. So the next best number we can track is the number of users [paying for Orion](kagi.com/onboarding?p=orion_plan).

We have a very simple visualisation of Orion+ member count at [kagi.com/stats](https://kagi.com/stats?sub_stats=orion).
