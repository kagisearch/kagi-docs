# What is Orion+?

[Orion+](https://browser.kagi.com/orionplus.html) allows you to support the Orion project and mission.

For a small fee ($5 per month, $50 per year, or $0for a lifetime subscription), you’ll get:

- Direct communication with the development team
- The ability to influence the browser’s development
- Access to nightly builds, bleeding-edge WebKit (faster than stable), and experimental features
- The satisfaction of supporting an ad-free, unmonetized browser
- An Orion+ icon to represent that support

We are still working on some of these features and they will be released shortly.

Your financial contribution will help us to stay independent and to deliver on our promise of becoming the best browser for our users. You can also help us by spreading the word about Orion everywhere you go, from social media to the dinner table.
